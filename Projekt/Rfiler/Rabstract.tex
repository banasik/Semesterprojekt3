\chapter{Abstract} 
This project investigates blood pressure meassurement and the examination of systolic and diastolic values, as well as a pulse, derived from blood pressure signals. The goal of this project is to construct hardware which is able to manipulate and adapt an analog signal from pressure force. A filter is used to amplify the signal before it travels to a Data Acquisition device. This device will transform the analog signal to a digital signal. Thereafter the transformed signal goes into the software-part, also constructed specifically for this project. Here, the objective of the program is to consist of developed algorythms which are able to determine and depict systolic and diastolic values. The signal is being observed from its starting time, where the software discovers maximum and minimum values, every third second. The maximum value correlates to the systolic value and the minimum correlates to the diastolic value.\\
Aside from the above, the program is able to do zero-point adjustment from startup, as well as calibrating whenever a researcher finds it necessary. This project is made for research, and it is therefore fundemental that researchers are able to save their data values. Therefore, the program includes a database, where data values can be stored.\\
The result of this project presents; it is possible to meassure a blood pressure using hardware and software components. Through future development it can be possible to detect elevated and supressed blood pressures by the same program. This would be usefull if, in the near future, this project were to be used on patients. Although, throughout the project, the main focus has been measurements of blood pressure for research purposes.
